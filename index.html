    <h1>JavaScript is fun, but so is HTML and CSS</h1>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p class="first">
      You can learn JavaScript without HTML and CSS, but for DOM manipulation
      it's useful to have some basic ideas about HTML and CSS. The head is used
      for the settings of the page (also for Style -> for CSS). In HTML some
      elements can have attributes and these attributes describe elements. Href
      is an attribute that belongs only to a (anchor) element. Src is an
      attribute that belongs only to the img (image) element. The anchor element
      is an inline element. Classes and id's are attributes that can be used in
      any element. Id's need to be unique. Classes can be used over and over. In
      CSS and HTML no cammelCase, but test-test. Boxes = div. You can find out
      more about HTML

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p class="second">
      We use CSS to style elements and to create a layout for the overall page.
      We can write CSS in the HTML document using the STYLE element. Style is
      not for the visible content on the page, so it should be in the head.To
      style elements we need to first select them. There are multiple selectors
      in CSS. The most basic one is the element selector (we can select with it
      all elements of a certain type). But it is better to write css in a
      different file. With the star selector we can select all the elements on a
      page.

    <h4>The box model (CSS)</h4>
    <p>
      The main factor that defines how elements are displayed on a webpage and
      also how they are sized. Block elements create a box around them (ex: h2).
      Inline elements only occupy the text itself (ex a -> anchor -> href).
